# GriddleMeet

The app that allows the hungry SF foodie to view Food truck location, availability, menu, and operating hours information via interactive map.

The app also allows food truck owners to signup, login, create food truck info, populate that information on a map for foodies to visit.  

A win-win for both the foodie and the truckie.
